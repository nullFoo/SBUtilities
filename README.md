# SBAlchemy
A program that calculates the cheapest materials to level alchemy in Hypixel Skyblock

## Usage
This requires you to have python version 3.6 or above (earlier versions might work, I haven't tried) and to install the `requests` and `time` modules. After that you can just run it and put in your api key (from my experience the api key isnt even needed you can just type 123 but i dont want to remove that bit in case it breaks).
